ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheW00ds (Mike Anderson).
- ðŸ‘€ For languages/runtimes I enjoy working with Python, TS (NodeJS), c# and Java. In no particular order.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always working on something. Love playing with shiney new toys and frameworks so I end up building the same thing over and over. At the moment I have been playing with NestJs and NextJs. Obsessing over tooling and environment setup mostly. Its a surprisingly fun game of "Whats the quickest and laziest way I can setup my env and get to continuously deploying HEAPS of trash code that has no purpose?!".

Maybe one day I will pubish something!!
